# vue-lib-example

This repository is an example for a medium post on how to create a vue component for the community.

This post will walk you through the process of creating a npm ready js package, and make a demo website using Github Pages. Have a look at the post [here]().

You can also just clone this repository and replace `MyComponent.vue` and its references with your component.
